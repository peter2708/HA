Display 2 is a bastard son of a working prototype and a new display.
The riddle of storing set values from one module to another, and that of working sub menu displays has to now be addressed.
 *  Essentially a working prototype
 * Bass and mid controls, pan, wah, ring modulation and a poorly working synth
 *  #################### Road Test  ############################
 *  Wah sounds a bit tinny, find a sweeter center frequency, or change filter type   -   update . Much improved
 * Output distorts when I play hard -- first check that this is not the input, then adjust all mixer levels  - update : seems to be fixed, still to be checked on a good amp
 * Tone control needs adjusting, only route here is just to play loud
 * 
 *  ############### TO DO ############################
 *  1. Refine Synth Effect
 *  2. Add Distortion, Chorus and Granular Synth
 *  3. Add Hi pass to bass tone control (it can boost top end until the last 20 to 30 encoder values)
 *  4. Consider further effects, and control options
 *  
 *  Effects possibilities:
 *  1. Distortion
 *  2. Compression
 *  3. Chorus
 *  4. Octaver
 *  5. Bass Balls
 *  7. Sample Trigger 
 *      a. auto accomp drums
 *      b. single note trigger
 *      c. Drum loop
*   8. Convolution
*   9. Sytnh
*   10. Delay
*   11. Reverb
*   12. Loopstation
*   13. Tone controls OPFilter.setLowpass(0,400,.7); etc
*
